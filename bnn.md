# Bayesian Neural Networks

## Week 1 (24 Jan - 31 Jan)

### Objectives

- [ ] Read and undrestand the paper [Scalable Bayesian neural networks by layer-wise input augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13498) (iBNN)
- [ ] Implement iBNN and test it on FashionMNIST.

### What I've learned or done
- Veriational inference:
